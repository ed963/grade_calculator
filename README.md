# grade_calculator

This is a simple grade calculator created with Python's tkinter and sqlite3 modules.

### Usage

To use the grade calculator, run

> python interface.py

The courses and assignments are stored locally in database file, so they can be accessed when the grade calculator is opened again at a later time. This allows for assignments and courses to be continuously updated, say, throughout a school year.

### Other Information

I created this project as I was learning the basics of GUI development and SQL.
